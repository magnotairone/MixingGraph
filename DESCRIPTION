Description: An approach for estimating the graph of conditional dependencies in a random vector based on finite sample data. We define this approach as a global model selection criterion, which means optimizing a function across the entire set of potential graphs, removing the need to estimate and combine individual neighborhoods as commonly proposed in the literature.
